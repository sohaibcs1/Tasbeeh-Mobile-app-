# Tasbeeh application
This application contains four parts, Tasbih(for Dhikr), Compass(for Qibla Location), Azan Alarm(for Prayer Times), Google Map(To find the Mosque/Location)

# Tasbih Instructions
Itâ€™s a tasbeeh counter application. We can use this mobile application for the names of ALLAH or any dhikr. Select the dhikr and count it. Even you close the Tasbeeh application, the number of the dhikr will not be erased. When you restart the application, the dhikr number will appear on the screen. Using buttons, you can pulse/decrement in the number and can reset.

# Compass Instructions
I have designed the compass that guides us about the direction we want to proceed. This compass accuracy depends entirely on the sensors in your device. Keep your device away from magnetic fields because such fields interfere with the compass sensor.
